## About me

Web developer with 8 years of experience building systems and websites using popular web technologies such as PHP, Node.JS, AngularJS, ExpressJS, MySQL/MariaDB. As a tech enthusiast, I'm always trying to learn new ones like Elm and Apache Cassandra and consolidated ones such as Functional programming.
I'm an fan of OpenSource / Free Software as I see it as a way of democratize technology and a way to include everyone, if they want, in the new world 
created in this process.
